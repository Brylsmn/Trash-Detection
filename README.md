# Trash Detection App

## Overview
The Trash Detection App is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to utilize a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model for detecting trash in the surrounding environment. The app provides an intuitive interface for users to choose between real-time trash detection via the device’s camera or detection based on an input image.

---

## Features
- **Real-time Trash Detection**: Opens the device’s camera to detect trash in real-time.
- **Image-based Detection**: Allows users to upload an image for trash detection.
- **Fine-tuned Model**: Utilizes a YOLOv8 model fine-tuned for precise trash detection.

---

## Model Details
- **Detection Algorithm**: YOLOv8  
- **Training Dataset**: The YOLOv8 model was fine-tuned using a dataset sourced from [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com/nickiwiki-ql54s/hybrid-2).

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for video input.
- Provide feedback on detected trash types and disposal suggestions.
- Integrate a map feature for locating nearby trash bins.
- Develop into a mobile application.
